1. You can find the app on separated github repository on this link :
	https://github.com/AnantaPW/BasicGolangServices.git/
	
2. CI/CD Pipeline
	For the CI/CD I use jenkins to help me with the task, you can find all the jenkins pipeline script used for this task here:
	https://github.com/AnantaPW/jenkins-cicd
	
	The foldering reflect the job foldering on my jenkins.
	Here are the detail of the job:
	- BUILD-PROJECT
		This job use copyArtifact plugin to copy workspace items from CHECKOUT-SCM job and then build it and deploy it to the server. 
		If we want to deploy to multiple server it would be better to make a dedicated Deploy pipeline instead making a
		deploying stage. We can use the copyArtifact plugin to copy the build result from this pipeline into the Deploy pipeline. 
		Using jenkins enable us to deploying into all the server in parallel.
	
	- BUILD-DOCKER-IMAGE
		This job checkout the project from git using different method from the latter. We don't use copyArtifact plugin to copy build
		result from another job, but we checkout the project from github directly into this job workspace. This approach is better when 
		we don't have to manage many branch on the project. Using the docker plugin we build the image of our project based on the dockerfile.
		Then I push the image to docker hub. 
	
	- CHECKOUT-SCM
		For this job i used the jenkins freestyle option because we don't need any complex command for this task. Here is the configuration for
		the pipeline:
		- GitHub project:
			Project url : https://github.com/AnantaPW/BasicGolangServices.git/
		- Delete workspace before build starts
		- Post-build Actions:
			File to archive : *
	
	*If needed, i might find a way to deploy the jenkins so it can be accessed from the public internet.
